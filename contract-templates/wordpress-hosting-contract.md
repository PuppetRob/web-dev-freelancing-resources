## Timeline & Milestones

If we already have an export of or are hosting your site, the hosting will begin within 1 business day of this contract being signed.

If we do not have your website, you must provide us with a full, working export of the entire site. If there are things that are broken when we import your site, we will provide you with an estimate to fix them before proceeding. After a clean import or all remediations are complete, we will provide you with a staging site for sign-off before we launch the site and start the hosting.

## WordPress Hosting Providers

We do not directly provide WordPress hosting ourselves. Instead, we have contracts with WordPress hosting providers and manage client sites (like yours) using their services.

Transparently, they charge us, and we charge you because we actively manage the hosting and provide all the services listed under Scope of Services.

If you ever want to know with what WordPress Hosting Provider(s) we are currently working with, please reach out to us, and we will be happy to provide that.

Because we use different WordPress Hosting Providers, there may be variations in Hard Drive Size and Bandwidth for sites, but as a benchmark, we maintain the following for all our clients:

- 10GB Webspace
- 50,000 Monthly Site Visits
- Unmetered "reasonable" traffic

If you are ever not happy with our hosting services, let us know and we will be happy to work with you, help you offboard from us to a different host, or to train you on managing your own hosting.

## WordPress Plugins & Third Party Code

In order to complete everything in the Scope of Services, we will likely need to install third party plugins or code onto your site. For a list of third party assets we use to perform our services, please reach out to us. We always make every effort to keep all third-party software, platforms, plugins, and code up to date with the most recent production releases. We also do our best to only use assets that are made by reputable sources and that are regularly maintained.

## Cyber Security

The WordPress platform and any third party assets (see the WordPress Plugins & Third Party Code section) we use on your website were not originally developed by us and are not maintained by us; thus we are not liable for any hacking or intrusion into them based on flaws with or vulnerabilities to them.

The servers used for the WordPress Hosting we contract from affiliates are not owned or operated by us; thus we are not liable for any hacking or intrusion to them based on flaws with or vulnerabilities to them. We only use reputable WordPress Hosting providers.

## What Do Both Parties Agree To?

You: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company, or your organization. You’ll give us the assets and information we tell you we need to complete the project. You’ll do this when we ask and provide it in the formats we ask for. You’ll review our work, and provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. You understand that our ability to complete our work outlined in the Project Scope is contingent on your fulfilling your obligations and deliverables outlined in this agreement.

Us: We have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed with you and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We’ll endeavor to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that, we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.

## Exclusivity

Unless approved by both parties, we will not provide competing services to any of your competitors and your use of any other third party providing the same services in this contract will be considered a violation of these terms in which the face value of the contract will be owed in full.

Any contractors involved in this contract will either be direct employees or partners of ours, contractors sourced by us, or full-time employees and partners of yours. Any part-time employee of yours will be bound by the same NDA and Non-compete contracts that we use for internal employees and contractors.

## Intellectual Property Rights

Just to be clear, “Intellectual property rights” means all patents, rights to inventions, copyright (including rights to software) and related rights, trademarks, service marks, get-up and trade names, internet domain names, rights to goodwill or to sue for passing off, rights in designs, database rights, rights in confidential information (including know-how) and any other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all applications (or rights to apply) for, and renewals or extensions of, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or shall subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.

Although we are managing the hosting of your site, you may still be adding and/or editing content on the site.

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images, or other media you put onto your site are either owned by you or that you’ve permission to use them. When you put text, images, or other media onto your site, you agree to protect us from any claim by a third party that we’re hosting a website using their intellectual property.

In the event we make any changes to your website (under your direction), we guarantee that all elements of the work we deliver to you are either owned by us or we’ve obtained permission to provide them to you. When we provide text, images, or other media to you, we agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that you’re using their intellectual property.

## Dispute Resolution

If there is a disagreement about this contract or the services we are providing you, both parties will attempt to negotiate and come to a mutual resolution. In the event that a mutual resolution cannot be reached through good faith negotiations, the disagreement shall be referred to arbitration. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding. The non-prevailing Party shall pay the reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs associated with enforcing the judgment of the arbitration) to the prevailing Party.

## Other Legal Stuff

While this entire contract is a binding legal document, there are a couple of points we make sure to include here that do not fall into any other category:

We’ll carry out our work in accordance with good industry practice and at the standard expected from a suitably qualified person with relevant experience. That said, we can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and we will not be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental, consequential, or special damages, due to any act or omission while carrying out our work under this agreement, even if you’ve advised us of them. In the event our agreement ends, you will have full access to all our work, and you will be able to log in as us to all of your platforms, so there is no warranty on the work done under this contract after our agreement ends.

Your liability to us will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under this contract and you won’t be liable to us or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental, consequential, or special damages, even if we’ve advised you of them.

Any changes to this contract must be made in writing and approved by both parties.

Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## Cost, Payments, & Invoicing

## Contract Renewal

This contract will renew every month and remain in place until either party informs the other one of the desire to terminate the contract. At that point, we will continue to provide you with the Scope of Services outlined in this contract through the end of the current month. This contract will end at the end of that month.

## Final Details

Neither you nor we can transfer this contract to anyone else without the other’s permission.

Both parties agree that they will adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in relation to our activities under this contract and not cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.

Should either party want to end the contract before that happens, they must do so in writing and you will be responsible for paying me for all work done up until that point.
