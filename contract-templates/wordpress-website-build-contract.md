## Timeline & Milestones

`[EDIT THIS SECTION EACH CONTRACT]`

We like to measure our work in milestones, so everyone knows the roadmap and due dates for things.

The following milestones are due at the end of the indicated weeks, starting the date this contract is signed. Note, these deadlines give everyone enough time to complete their tasks even when life happens. In the event things are completed faster, the timeline will move up accordingly and the project may finish much quicker than estimated below.

1. (INVOICE - 30% Deposit) Contract is signed
2. We confirm the number and layout of pages with you - Weeks 1-2
3. Website build - Weeks 3-5
   - 3a. You finalize your content and provide it to us - Week 4
4. Content Review 1 - Week 6
5. Content Review 1 Alterations - Week 7
6. Content Review 2 - Week 8
7. Content Review 2 Alterations - Week 9
8. (INVOICE - Remaining Balance) WordPress Training and Hand-off call and final sign-off - Week 10
   - 8a. Website is launched and production tests are completed (if we are hosting) OR website export is provided to you (if we are not hosting) - Week 10

The due dates for the milestones above are estimates. Please pay special attention to "3a. You finalize your content and provide it to us". This is most often the milestone that can delay the delivery of the final product. It is very important that you get all your finalized content (text, pictures, videos, social media links, etc) to us by Week 4 so we have the time to build out the site on schedule. If we are waiting for content from you, the entire timeline may be pushed back (except for payments as discussed in the Payments & Invoicing section).

This contract ends 10 weeks from the date both parties have signed it.

## What Do Both Parties Agree To?

You: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company, or your organization. You’ll give us the assets and information we tell you we need to complete the project. You’ll do this when we ask and provide it in the formats we ask for. You’ll review our work, and provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. You understand that our ability to complete our work outlined in the Project Scope is contingent on your fulfilling your obligations and deliverables outlined in this agreement.

Us: We have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed with you and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We’ll endeavor to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that, we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.

## Site Design and Construction

We will use the WordPress platform and third party customized, licensed themes, plugins, and code to create your site. We take this approach because we've found it to be the most robust, professional, and cost-effective way to make beautiful and functional websites. We use out-of-the-box HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and database code included in WordPress and other third party assets in addition to any custom code we write and use minification and polyfills when available.

You will have the opportunity to review and approve the original base theme and suggest any customizations you would like. We will always optimize any digital assets you provide us for site performance. The website will be constructed so that you will be able to update the content yourself after launch, should you so desire, without any coding knowledge. A hand-off call will be scheduled when appropriate to teach you how to make edits to the site.

If, at any stage, you change your mind about what you want to be delivered and are not happy with the direction our work is taking you’ll pay us in full for the time we’ve spent working with you until that point and terminate this contract.

While the website is being developed, unless otherwise directed by us, we ask that you do not edit anything directly on the site. As part of the final sign-off for the site, we will provide you with an admin account to the WordPress CMS backend for the site.

## WordPress Plugins & Third Party Code

In order to complete everything in the Scope of Services, we will likely need to install third party plugins or code onto your site. For a list of third party assets we use to perform our services, please reach out to us. We always make every effort to keep all third-party software, platforms, plugins, and code up to date with the most recent production releases. We also do our best to only use assets that are made by reputable sources and that are regularly maintained.

## Text Content

We will enter all text content you provide us into the website but will not take the liberty of writing any new text content for you. We will supply you with an itemized list of the pieces of text content we need from you and will work together on their expected delivery dates.

If you would like us to write new text content for your site, let us know and we can talk about options.

## Graphics, Photographs, and Other Media

You will be providing us with all the graphics, photographs, and other media required for your site that are not included in a pre-selected WordPress theme. You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high-resolution digital format.

If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries. If you’d like us to search for photographs or generate graphics for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

## Browser Testing & Responsiveness

Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), and Mozilla Firefox. We won’t test in other older browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 for Windows, unless agreed upon separately.

Mobile browser Testing using popular smaller-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. We test our designs in the latest versions of Safari and Google Chrome on the latest iOS for iPhones only.

We won’t test on Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, Android devices, Windows, or other mobile browsers unless agreed upon separately.

## Web Hosting

We provide web hosting while your site is in development. In order to launch the website, there will need to be web hosting set up after the end of this contract. We offer web hosting for our clients via our web hosting contracts with providers. Once your website is complete, you have 2 options for how we handle hosting:

- Option 1: we set up and manage web hosting for your website on a monthly basis (to be invoiced outside of this contract). While we are acting as your web hosts, we will perform weekly performance and security checks, update WordPress plugins and themes as necessary, and maintain regular backups of your site.
- Option 2: we provide you with an export of the entire WordPress site from our development web hosting and provide no ongoing services.

## Search engine optimization (SEO)

We do not (and cannot) guarantee improvements to your website’s search engine ranking, but the web pages that we develop are accessible to search engines and we ensure all relevant metadata is comprehensive and discoverable by search engines to find when the website is launched. If you need ongoing SEO support and optimization, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

## Cyber Security

The WordPress platform and any third party assets (see the WordPress Plugins & Third Party Code section) we use on your website were not originally developed by us and are not maintained by us; thus we are not liable for any hacking or intrusion into them based on flaws with or vulnerabilities to them.

The servers used for the WordPress Hosting we contract from affiliates are not owned or operated by us; thus we are not liable for any hacking or intrusion to them based on flaws with or vulnerabilities to them. We only use reputable WordPress Hosting providers.

## Changes and Revisions

We don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price in this contract includes 2 full rounds of revisions to the content of the website. That means after both parties agree on the design (aka the theme with any customizations) and the structure (aka the number of pages), we will enter all the content you provide us into the site, and you will then have 2 opportunities ("Content Reviews") to do a full review of the site and provide feedback on content changes that need to be made.

After those 2 rounds of Content Reviews, if you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem, but we will provide a separate estimate for that additional work. While it may not seem like a lot right now, from our experience, 2 rounds are enough to make sure everything is polished and complete while still allowing the website to move forward and not get stuck in an endless cycle of editing things back and forth.

Please note that Content Reviews in this section refer to changes to the content (text, images, media, etc) on the site, and not about the structure. For example, if you decide that you want 3 more pages on the website during the second round of Content Reviews, that would prompt a separate estimate.

## Displaying Our Work

We love to show off our work, so we reserve the right to display all aspects of our creative work, including sketches, work-in-progress designs, and the completed project discussed in this contract on our portfolio and in articles on websites, magazines, and books.

With your consent, we would love to include a discrete banner at the bottom of the site, indicating that we did the build; we do not require this.

## Exclusivity

Unless approved by both parties, we will not provide competing services to any of your competitors and your use of any other third party providing the same services in this contract will be considered a violation of these terms in which the face value of the contract will be owed in full.

Any contractors involved in this contract will either be direct employees or partners of ours, contractors sourced by us, or full-time employees and partners of yours. Any part-time employee of yours will be bound by the same NDA and Non-compete contracts that we use for internal employees and contractors.

## Intellectual Property Rights

Just to be clear, “Intellectual property rights” means all patents, rights to inventions, copyright (including rights to software) and related rights, trademarks, service marks, get-up and trade names, internet domain names, rights to goodwill or to sue for passing off, rights in designs, database rights, rights in confidential information (including know-how) and any other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all applications (or rights to apply) for, and renewals or extensions of, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or shall subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images, or other media you provide are either owned by you or that you’ve permission to use them. When you provide text, images, or other media to us, you agree to protect us from any claim by a third party that we’re using their intellectual property.

We guarantee that all elements of the work we deliver to you are either owned by us or we’ve obtained permission to provide them to you. When we provide text, images, or other media to you, we agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that you’re using their intellectual property.

Provided you’ve paid for the work and that this contract hasn’t been terminated, we’ll assign all intellectual property rights to you as follows:

- You’ll own the website we design for you. We will export a copy of the entire site as well as any applicable license keys and provide that to you when the website launches. You should keep them somewhere safe as we’re not required to keep a copy.
- You own all intellectual property rights of text, images, site specifications, and data you provided unless someone else owns them.
- We’ll own any intellectual property rights we’ve developed prior to, or developed separately from this project and not paid for by you.

## Dispute Resolution

If there is a disagreement about this contract or the services we are providing you, both parties will attempt to negotiate and come to a mutual resolution. In the event that a mutual resolution cannot be reached through good faith negotiations, the disagreement shall be referred to arbitration. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding. The non-prevailing Party shall pay the reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs associated with enforcing the judgment of the arbitration) to the prevailing Party.

## Other Legal Stuff

While this entire contract is a binding legal document, there are a couple of points we make sure to include here that do not fall into any other category:

We’ll carry out our work in accordance with good industry practice and at the standard expected from a suitably qualified person with relevant experience. That said, we can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental, consequential, or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them. Additionally, once the website is launched, you will have full admin access to the site, so there is no warranty on the work done under this contract.

Your liability to us will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under this contract and you won’t be liable to us or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental, consequential, or special damages, even if we’ve advised you of them.

Any changes to this contract must be made in writing and approved by both parties.

Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
