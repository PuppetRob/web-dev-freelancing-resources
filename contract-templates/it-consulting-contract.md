## Summary

`[EDIT THIS SECTION EACH CONTRACT]`

We’ll always do our best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that everyone knows what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract, you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. We’ve no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What we do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

## Equipment

We will be ready to provide and use our own equipment to complete our work under this contract.

In the event that you provide equipment for us to use, we will use that equipment in good faith and only for the work described under this contract, although we cannot guarantee that we will do 100% of the work under this contract on the equipment you provide.

## What Do Both Parties Agree To?

You: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company, or your organization. You’ll give us the assets and information we tell you we need to complete the project. You’ll do this when we ask and provide it in the formats we ask for. You’ll review our work, and provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. You understand that our ability to complete our work outlined in the Scope of Services is contingent on your fulfilling your obligations and deliverables outlined in this agreement.

Us: We have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed with you and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We’ll endeavor to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that, we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.

## Cyber Security

We do not own or host any platform we will be using in our work together, nor were any of them originally developed by us and are not maintained by us; thus we are not liable for any hacking or intrusion into them based on flaws with or vulnerabilities to them.

## Exclusivity

Unless approved by both parties, we will not provide competing services to any of your competitors and your use of any other third party providing the same services in this contract will be considered a violation of these terms in which the face value of the contract will be owed in full.

Any contractors involved in this contract will either be direct employees or partners of ours, contractors sourced by us, or full-time employees and partners of yours. Any part-time employee of yours will be bound by the same NDA and Non-compete contracts that we use for internal employees and contractors.

## Intellectual Property Rights

Just to be clear, “Intellectual property rights” means all patents, rights to inventions, copyright (including rights to software) and related rights, trademarks, service marks, get-up and trade names, internet domain names, rights to goodwill or to sue for passing off, rights in designs, database rights, rights in confidential information (including know-how) and any other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all applications (or rights to apply) for, and renewals or extensions of, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or shall subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images, or other media you provide are either owned by you or that you’ve permission to use them. When you provide text, images, or other media to us, you agree to protect us from any claim by a third party that we’re using their intellectual property.

We guarantee that all elements of the work we deliver to you are either owned by us or we’ve obtained permission to provide them to you. When we provide text, images, or other media to you, we agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that you’re using their intellectual property.

Provided you’ve paid for the work and that this contract hasn’t been terminated, we’ll assign all intellectual property rights to you as follows:

- You'll own all of the work product we produce specifically to fulfill the responsibilities listed in the Scope of Services in this contract.
- You'll own all platform/service engagements or agreements that we establish and manage for the purposes of the services under this contract.
- We will own everything we produce or work on (on our equipment) that is not directly related to us providing you services under this contract.

## Dispute Resolution

If there is a disagreement about this contract or the services we are providing you, both parties will attempt to negotiate and come to a mutual resolution. In the event that a mutual resolution cannot be reached through good faith negotiations, the disagreement shall be referred to arbitration. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding. The non-prevailing Party shall pay the reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs associated with enforcing the judgment of the arbitration) to the prevailing Party.

## Independent Contractor Capacity

In working under this contract, we are acting as an independent contractor and not as an employee. Both parties acknowledge that this contract does not create a partnership or joint venture between them, and is exclusively a contract for service. You are not required to pay, or make any contributions to, any social security, local, state or federal tax, unemployment compensation, workers' compensation, insurance premium, profit-sharing, pension or any other employee benefit for us during the Term. We are responsible for paying, and complying with reporting requirements for, all local, state and federal taxes related to payments made to the us under this contract.

Except as otherwise provided in this contract, we will have full control over working time, methods, and decision-making in relation to the work under this Contract. We will work autonomously and not at your direction. However, we will be responsive to your reasonable needs and concerns.

## Other Legal Stuff

While this entire contract is a binding legal document, there are a couple of points we make sure to include here that do not fall into any other category:

We’ll carry out our work in accordance with good industry practice and at the standard expected from a suitably qualified person with relevant experience. That said, we can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and we will not be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental, consequential, or special damages, due to any act or omission while carrying out our work under this agreement, even if you’ve advised us of them. In the event our agreement ends, you will have full access to all our work, and you will be able to log in as us to all of your platforms, so there is no warranty on the work done under this contract after our agreement ends.

Your liability to us will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under this contract and you won’t be liable to us or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings, or other incidental, consequential, or special damages, even if we’ve advised you of them.

Any changes to this contract must be made in writing and approved by both parties.

Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## Cost, Payments, & Invoicing

`[EDIT THIS SECTION EACH CONTRACT]`

The hourly rate for the work we are responsible for under this contract is $`[hourly_rate]`. This does not include any third-party platforms, licenses, hardware, or other resources we need to purchase to meet your requirements - those will be communicated to you for approval and either purchased by you or we will invoice you for them separately.

We will do my best to work in blocks of full hours to be efficient with our time, but keep in mind that the minimum amount of billable time we will record is 30 minutes. This means we will group tasks together to work full hours when we can, but in the event we need to be responsive to an emergency or critical issue, we will round up to the closest 30-minute mark to billing and invoicing purposes.

Equipment, hardware inventory, or storage equipment/furniture/fixtures required to store your materials in my office will be approved by you and either purchased using your funds or we will invoice you for reimbursement.

We would sincerely appreciate you promptly paying all invoices we send; we do sincerely enjoy working together, but we are also doing this for the money. You agree to the following invoicing and payment terms:

- We issue invoices electronically.
- Payments are due 14 days from the date of invoice.
- All invoices are quoted in USD. You agree to pay all charges associated with international transfers of funds, if applicable.
- The appropriate bank account or approved payment method details will be available in the invoice.
- We reserve the right to charge interest on all overdue debts at the rate of 5% per month or fraction of a month.
- We reserve the right to change our hourly rate at anytime with a minimum of 90 days notice (unless otherwise mutually agree upon by both parties).

## Contract Renewal

This contract will renew every month and remain in place until either party informs the other one of the desire to terminate the contract. At that point, we will continue to provide you with the Scope of Services outlined in this contract through the end of the current month. This contract will end at the end of that month.

## Final Details

Neither you nor we can transfer this contract to anyone else without the other’s permission.

Both parties agree that they will adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in relation to our activities under this contract and not cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.

If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Should either party want to end the contract before that happens, they must do so in writing and you will be responsible for paying me for all work done up until that point.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a binding legal document. This contract's interpretation, enforcement, and performance are governed by the laws of the State of California in the United States of America.
