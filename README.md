# web-dev-freelancing-resources

Various resources for web development freelancing that I use on a regular basis. My general approach is to have language that is easy to understand for both parties and not be intimidating legal language we often see in contracts.

If anyone has feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out!

# Contents

1. A contract template for building a WordPress website
2. A contract for WordPress website hosting
3. A contract for Computer Repair (or other physical, in-person computer services)

_Note: The original inspiration and baseline template was an online resource shared by another freelance web developer - I could not find the repo and don't remember their name, but if anyone recognizes it, please flag it to me and I will update this, giving credit where credit is due!_
